# Week 2 Day 3: APIs, Async, SDKs, and a First Look at DataFrames

**Module:** Intermediate Python, APIs, and an early bridge into pandas/Polars
**Estimated time:** flexible; see `## How the day fits together` below
**Format:** Individual build, pair review
**Environment:** Linux terminal, VS Code, Chrome, GitHub, UV
**Difficulty:** Intermediate

## How the day fits together

Day 3 has three parts. The instructor sets the actual pacing (this can run
long, spill into homework, or extend into Day 4; do not treat the time
estimates below as fixed):

1. **Guided notebooks** (Activity 1, then Activity 2): concept-first, richly
   explained, with worked examples and a few "your turn" sections. This is
   where new ideas get introduced.
2. **Independent build** (`Bonus_Lab_Weather_API_Explorer.ipynb`): the same
   category of skills (fetch, handle failures, retry, summarize, ship a CLI),
   built up from a blank file with much less scaffolding, ending in a runnable
   `weather_explorer.py`. This is where you prove you actually learned it, not
   just followed along. The Bonus Lab walks the build in progressive
   iterations; the finished `weather_explorer.py` is the deliverable.
3. **DataFrame Fundamentals** (Activity 3): a first look at pandas and Polars,
   using the real data you collected in Activity 1, bridging into Day 4's
   deeper pandas/Polars/cloud-shipping work.

## Setup

Complete `Activity_0_UV_API_Project_Setup.md` first. Day 3 does not start a new
per-day project. It creates **one shared UV project at the repo root** (the
folder VS Code already has open), reused for the rest of Week 2, so VS Code
auto-detects its `.venv` as your interpreter and notebook kernel. From the repo
root:

```bash
uv init
uv add requests httpx python-dotenv boto3 google-genai pandas polars ipykernel
```

`ipykernel` is what lets VS Code use this environment as a notebook kernel. The
`.venv`, `pyproject.toml`, and `uv.lock` are created at the repo root and are
gitignored, so `git pull` never touches them. Your own work (copied notebooks,
`weather_explorer.py`, any `data/` you create) goes under `student-work/week2/`
so it never conflicts with a `git pull`. The full step-by-step, including the
first-time kernel selection in VS Code, is in
`Activity_0_UV_API_Project_Setup.md`.

Confirm the environment:

```bash
uv run python -c "import requests, pandas, polars; print('env ok')"
```

Activity 2 reads a Gemini key from a `.env` file. Create `.env` at the repo root
and make sure `.env` is gitignored so secrets never reach Git. (Activity 2's S3
read is unsigned and needs no AWS key.)

## Independent Build: `weather_explorer.py`

After the guided notebooks, prove the skills from a blank file. The **Bonus
Lab** (`Bonus_Lab_Weather_API_Explorer.ipynb`) walks you through building
`weather_explorer.py` in progressive iterations: one request, wrap it in a
function, several cities (sync then async), add a retry with backoff, and
finally ship it as a command-line tool. The finished script is the deliverable.

You build it in your work folder at `student-work/week2/`, starting from
`starter/weather_explorer_starter.py` (copied in during Activity 0). It uses
Open-Meteo, which is free and keyless.

Run it from your work folder; `uv run` finds the repo-root environment
automatically:

```bash
cd student-work/week2
uv run python weather_explorer.py "Hartford,US" 41.7658 -72.6734
```

Expected output shape (real numbers vary):

```text
Weather for Hartford,US
  current: 71.6F
  today's low:  61.2F
  today's high: 78.4F
```

### Success Criteria

- `weather_explorer.py` runs from the command line with a city label and
  latitude/longitude, and prints today's min, max, and current-hour temperature.
- A transient failure is retried with exponential backoff, not left to crash on
  the first error.
- The fetch uses `timeout=10` and checks the response before using the body.
- You can explain why the retry function wraps the plain fetch function instead
  of duplicating its logic.

### Stretch

- Add a `--humidity` flag that also prints the day's average humidity.
- Refactor the functions into a small client class so `main()` reads top to
  bottom in a few lines.

## Submit

Commit these under your course repo (via a pull request, then leave two
substantive review comments on a teammate's PR):

```text
student-work/week2/weather_explorer.py
student-work/week2/Activity_1_HTTP_and_REST_Fundamentals.ipynb
student-work/week2/Activity_2_Async_SDKs_and_the_AI_Era.ipynb
student-work/week2/Activity_3_DataFrame_Fundamentals.ipynb
```

The shared environment files (`pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`) live at the repo
root, and `.venv/` is gitignored, so those are not committed as student work.
