# TechCatalyst DE 2026: Proposed Curriculum

This is an 8-week Data Engineering Bootcamp curriculum for **TechCatalyst DE 2026**.

![image-20240612110851319](images/image-20240612110851319.png)

This hands-on program is designed for fresh graduates and junior data engineers (1–2 years of experience). The core objective is to prepare students for production-grade roles by modeling a single, continuous, real-world industry project—the **Large-Scale Data Ingestion & Analytics Pipeline**—thoughtfully mapped across the entire course. 

The 2026 curriculum shifts primary cloud focus to **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** (with AWS as a secondary conceptual overlay), introduces modern data stack standards with **Snowflake** and **dbt**, integrates **AI-native features** (Cortex AI, Gemini API, and Vertex AI), incorporates **Big Data processing with PySpark & Databricks**, and establishes a strict, scaffolded developer progression to teach solid coding practices before introducing AI coding assistants like **GitHub Copilot**.

---

## Strategic Pedagogy: The Coding & AI Progression

To address the modern challenge where new engineers struggle to code due to over-reliance on autocomplete engines, this curriculum enforces a strict **"AI-Free Zone"** for the first four weeks:

1. **Weeks 1–4 (Foundations By Hand):** Students write Python, SQL, dbt, and Git commands from scratch. No GitHub Copilot or LLM-generated code is permitted. This builds syntax familiarity, debugging resilience, and a solid understanding of execution errors.
2. **Week 5 (Big Data & PySpark):** Students scale their coding skills using PySpark and Databricks as a learning environment, before transitioning to deploying production jobs on managed cloud clusters (GCP Dataproc and AWS EMR).
3. **Week 6 (AI Integration & Copilot):** **GitHub Copilot** is formally introduced. The focus is not just on code generation, but on **Prompt/Context Engineering** and **Rigorous Code Review/Validation workflows**. Students are trained to act as "code editors" who must verify correctness rather than blindly accepting AI suggestions.

---

## Longitudinal Project Thread: Large-Scale Ingestion & Analytics (e.g., NYC Taxi Data)

Instead of disjointed daily exercises, students work on a single continuous pipeline that processes a high-volume public dataset (such as the **NYC City Taxi Parquet dataset**, containing millions of rows, or a comparable client-specific dataset):
* **Week 1:** Design the conceptual lakehouse/warehouse pipeline architecture.
* **Week 2:** Pull and clean raw metadata records from a REST API and land them in GCS using Python.
* **Week 3:** Ingest event streaming and batch data via Pub/Sub and Dataflow, loading them into BigQuery tables, and apply PII masking.
* **Week 4:** Move data to Snowflake, run analytical SQL queries, write dbt models, write assertions to test quality, and set up a GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow to validate the code.
* **Week 5:** Scale processing using PySpark to transform large Parquet files, starting in Databricks and then executing batch jobs on GCP Dataproc and AWS EMR.
* **Week 6:** Call Vertex AI and the Gemini API to auto-classify and tag unstructured feedback or comments.
* **Week 7:** Connect interactive data applications (Streamlit) and enterprise BI dashboards (client's choice) to the cleaned data.
* **Week 8:** The Capstone. Teams integrate and deploy this end-to-end pipeline in a production-ready state.

## Platform Verification Notes (validated June 2026)

These platform facts were verified in June 2026 and supersede any earlier naming. See `Curriculum_Mapping_2026.md` for the day-by-day mapping.

* Instructor Note: for any changes, conflicts, I will keep this table updated.

| Platform | What changed / what to teach |
| :--- | :--- |
| **GCP DE** | Dataplex renamed **Knowledge Catalog** (Apr 2026). BigQuery began restricting Legacy SQL availability after June 1, 2026 — teach **GoogleSQL only**. **BigQuery Data Engineering Agent** now GA (natural-language pipeline building). Dataflow lineage in Knowledge Catalog is GA. |
| **GCP AI** | **Vertex AI** rebranded **Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform**; unified **google-genai SDK** replaces the deprecated `google-generativeai` package. Current models: Gemini 2.5 family (stable) and 3.x. Gemini callable from BigQuery SQL (`ML.GENERATE_TEXT` / AI functions) — DE-native GenAI pattern. |
| **AWS DE** | Focus on **SageMaker Lakehouse + S3 Tables (managed Iceberg) + Glue**. EMR still valid for the Spark deployment day; **S3 Tables** for Apache Iceberg. |
| **Snowflake** | **dbt Projects on Snowflake** runs dbt natively (incl. Fusion engine) . **Openflow** (managed NiFi) = ingestion. Cortex: **AISQL functions** (COMPLETE, CLASSIFY, SUMMARIZE…). Use current naming in slides. |
| **dbt** | **Fusion engine** (Rust, 30× faster parse) + official **VS Code extension** (requires Fusion, free). Will cover dbt with Fusion + VS Code; concepts identical to Core. |
| **Databricks** | Community Edition is retired → **Free Edition** (serverless which is what we will use in this class). Delta Lake, notebooks, SQL, basic Unity Catalog all work. Jobs/pipelines now branded **Lakeflow**. Certifications are out of scope for this cohort. |

### Week 8 — Capstone *(August 10–14)*

**Theme:** 100% project week — no new instruction. Teams build, integrate, and present their end-to-end pipeline using everything learned in Weeks 1–7.

> [!NOTE]
> Week 8 is a pure capstone sprint. The instructor's role shifts to coach/reviewer. No new concepts are introduced. Each day has a loose milestone to keep teams on track, but there are no scheduled lectures.

* **Day 1 — Architecture & Kickoff:** Teams finalize architecture diagrams and divide responsibilities. Daily stand-ups begin (15 min). Instructor reviews designs and flags risks.
* **Day 2 — Ingestion Sprint:** GCS → Dataflow/PySpark ETL → BigQuery or Snowflake. Teams use their own Week 3–5 code as the starting point; a pre-built template is available if needed.
* **Day 3 — Transformation & Governance Sprint:** Snowflake/dbt modeling, `dbt test`, PII masking, **Knowledge Catalog** lineage tagging.
* **Day 4 — AI Enrichment + BI/App Integration:** Cortex AI or Gemini API enrichment + Tableau dashboard or Streamlit app wired to the gold layer. Sub-teams merge work by end of day.
* **Day 5 — Final Presentations:** End-to-end live demo (10 min/team), architecture walkthrough, lessons-learned retrospective.

**Capstone Deliverable:** A fully operational, CI/CD-deployed data analytics pipeline — GCP ingestion, Snowflake/dbt modeling, PySpark processing, AI-enriched metadata, and a Tableau dashboard or Streamlit app — presented live on Day 5.
